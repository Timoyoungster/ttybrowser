# ttybrowser
## Underlying problem
I often would rather not have the browser running whilst coding.
**(battery saving, less distractions, minimalist feel, ...)**

But sometimes I just need a quick way to look something up on the
internet and so I end up starting the browser anyways.

## Solution
This project. It should be a quick way to run a google search and 
print out the results to the terminal in a human readable fashion.

## Availiable Commands
- search_string
- last
- history
